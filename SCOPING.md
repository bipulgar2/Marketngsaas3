SaaS Platform Features
Content Strategy Fundamentals
All features are built on three core principles:

Marketing Funnel — Content mapped to ToFu/MoFu/BoFu stages across the  sales life cycle
Customer Journey — Arrest users wherever they are; guide them forward
Branding — Build brand equity while driving conversions

The Unified Funnel Approach:

Every piece of content serves the funnel
Gated content captures leads at each stage
Email nurturing moves prospects toward conversion
Organic reach compounds over time
1. Competitor Analysis Engine
Pull competitor rankings, keywords, backlinks automatically
Side-by-side comparison: you vs them
"Beat them by 30%" strategy recommendations:
Enter competitor name -> Gets sitemap + blogs + backlinks + guest posts where they appear → generates visual map/library
Maps to sales lifecycle and intent keywords
Shows what blogs they have, content strategy, off-page content strategy
Different stages → different content → different keywords
Nature of content tied to off-page strategy
Gap analysis: keywords they rank for that you don't
2. Technical Audit System
Automated audit slides (Google Slides) for client presentations & pitches
Full website crawl (up to 500 pages)
On-page issues: titles, descriptions, headings, schema
PageSpeed + Core Web Vitals analysis
Backlink profile + referring domains
Content readability scoring
3. Audit → Task Assignment Flow
When an audit runs, the system automatically:
Identifies all issues (technical, content, link gaps)
Creates task checklists grouped by type
Campaign Manager assigns checklists to different departments 
Each department’s AI agents do the execution, overseen by the respective department managers 
Progress tracked until completion → reports generated

AUDIT RUNS
